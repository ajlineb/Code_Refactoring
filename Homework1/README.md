# Horiseon Home Page

## Description
Worked on a premade webpage and fixed several aspects about it.
Went through the code and simplified elements, classes, and ids.
Gave the website a title.
Setup the CSS stylesheet so that it flows smoothely with the html (linear).
Images now have alt attributes to describe them for easier access to the website.
