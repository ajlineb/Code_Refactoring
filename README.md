# Horiseon Home Page

## Description
Worked on a premade webpage and fixed several aspects about it.
Went through the code and simplified elements, classes, and ids.
Gave the website an infomative title.
Setup the CSS stylesheet so that it flows smoothly and orderly.
Images now have alt attributes to describe them for easier access to the website.
Added viewport meta tag for greater accessibility.
